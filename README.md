# Ukulele
...and his music was electric.

Ukulele is a bot made by the creator and collaborators of FredBoat. The concept is to replicate FredBoat while keeping it simple. The original stack is engineered for serving millions of servers, and is thus too complex to selfhost.

The bot is self-contained and only requires Java 11 to run.

This is currently work-in-progress.

## Host it yourself
- Make a copy of `ukulele.example.yml` and rename it to `ukulele.yml`
- Input the credentials requested
- Run `./ukulele` to build and run the application
